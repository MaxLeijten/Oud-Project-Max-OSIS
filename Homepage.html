			<h3>About OsisOS</h3>
			I started to make it because I realized that Windows 10 is actually pretty bad. For example, it does the following things with your computer:<br>
			<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- It runs a lot of tasks in the background that are unnecessary, your PC will only get slower.<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- It automatically installs bad games that all information can read from you. However, if you remove these games again, they will be back after about 2 updates of Windows 10.<br>
			<br>
			I also make this because it seems very nice to me and I want to make it a nice community! Do you join?
